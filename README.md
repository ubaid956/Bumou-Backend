### Notifications Module

The Notifications module provides a comprehensive system for managing user notifications, including notifications for comments and replies on posts (moments) following Facebook-like logic.

#### Notification Types

The system supports various notification types including:

- **MOMENT**: Notifications related to posts/moments
- **MESSAGE**: Notifications for chat messages
- **FRIENDSHIP**: Notifications for friend requests
- **GENERAL**: General system notifications

#### How Notifications Work

1. **Comment Notifications**: When a user comments on a post, the post owner receives a notification (unless they commented on their own post).
2. **Reply Notifications**: When a user replies to a comment, both the original commenter and the post owner receive notifications (unless they are the same person or the replier).
3. **Stored and Delivered**: All notifications are stored in the database and can also be delivered as push notifications.

#### Get All Notifications

```
GET /notifications?page=1&size=10
```

**Request Parameters:**

- `page` (query parameter, optional): Page number for pagination (default: 1)
- `size` (query parameter, optional): Number of results per page (default: 10)

**Authentication:**

- Requires JWT token (JwtGuard)

**Response:**

```json

}
```

#### Notification Events

Notifications are automatically created when:

1. **A user comments on a post**: The post owner receives a notification with metadata containing the post ID, comment ID, and commenter ID.
2. **A user replies to a comment**: Both the original comment owner and the post owner receive notifications with metadata containing the post ID, comment ID, reply ID, and replier ID.

**Implementation Notes:**

- Notifications follow a Facebook-like model for determining recipients
- Notifications include rich metadata allowing client applications to create deep links
- The system avoids sending notifications to users about their own actions
- Both database storage and push notifications are supported

### Moment Unread Count API

#### Get Unread Moments Count

Returns the count of unread comments and likes on moments since the user last viewed them.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "unreadComments": 5,
  "unreadLikes": 3,
  "totalUnread": 8
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Only counts interactions that happened after the user last viewed the post
- New posts that have never been viewed will have all interactions counted as unread

**Request Parameters:**

- `postId` (path parameter): ID of the post to mark as viewed

```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

  "totalUnread": 16
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

- Aggregates unread counts from moments, messages, and notifications in a single request
- Optimized to minimize database queries for performance
- Provides both individual category counts and a total count
- Helps client applications display accurate badge counts without multiple API calls
